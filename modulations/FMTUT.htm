<HR>
</I></FONT></CENTER></H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>Frequency Modulation (or FM) synthesis is a simple 
  and powerful method for creating and controlling complex spectra, introduced 
  by John Chowning of Stanford University around 1973. In its simplest form it 
  involves a sine wave carrier whose instantaneous frequency is varied, i.e. 
  modulated, according to the waveform (assumed here to be another sine wave) of 
  the so-called modulator. This model then is often called simple FM or 
  sine-wave FM. Other forms of FM are extensions of the basic model.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT size=+1>When the frequency of the modulator (which we'll call M) is 
  in the subaudio range (1-20 Hz), we can hear siren-like changes in pitch of 
  the carrier. However, when we raise M to the audio range (above 30 Hz) then we 
  hear a new timbre composed of frequencies called <B>sidebands</B>. To 
  determine which sidebands are present, we have to control the ratio between 
  the carrier frequency (C) and the modulating frequency (M). Instead of dealing 
  with these frequencies in Hz, we'll refer to this relationship as the <B>C : M 
  ratio</B>, keeping C and M as integers.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>You may click on any underlined ratio to hear a sound 
  example. In each case, the fundamental frequency is 100 Hz, both carrier and 
  modulator are sine waves, and the modulation index is swept from 0 to 2 with 
  the carrier envelope at a maximum.</FONT></P>
  <CENTER><FONT color=#af0000 size=+2><I>Properties of C:M 
  Ratios</I></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>First, about the properties of ratios, and some conventions 
  we're using:</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>We will only deal with ratios that are called non-reducible, 
  that is, those involving integers evenly divisible only by 1, and not by any 
  other integer. For example, the ratio 2:2 is the same as 1:1 and can be 
  reduced to it for all practical purposes. Likewise, 10:4 is the same as 5:2, 
  and 9:6 is the same as 3:2, and so on.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Secondly, we're going to divide all possible ratios into some 
  subgroups for ease of handling. One group will be those described as the 1:N 
  ratios. This means ratios like </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to3.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:3</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to4.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:4</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, etc. They will be found to have 
  particular properties.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Another group will be those described as N:M where N, M are 
  less than 10. In thise case, the restriction to single digit numbers is purely 
  for ease of arithmetic calculation. The last group is called 'large number 
  ratios', and this involves numbers 10 and up. Again, the division is 
  arbitrary. We won't deal with ratios like </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM100to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>100:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1> or </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM100to99.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>100:99</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>. Those are legitimate ones and you can 
  discover their properties through the sound examples. C:M ratios are sometimes 
  expressed with real numbers, e.g. the ratio 1:1.4, but these can be 
  approximated by integers, in this case </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM5to7.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>5:7</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>. In FM, a set of sidebands is produced 
  around the carrier C, <B>equally spaced at a distance equal to the modulating 
  frequency M.</B> Therefore, we often refer to the sidebands in pairs: 1st, 
  2nd, 3rd, and so on.</FONT></P>
  <CENTER><FONT color=#af0000 size=+2><I>Calculating 
  Sidebands</I></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>The so-called </FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=+1><B>upper 
  sidebands</B></FONT><FONT size=+1> are those lying above the carrier. Their 
  frequencies are: </FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>C+M, C+2M, C+3M, C+4M, C+5M, .... 
  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For example, if C:M is </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, that is, the modulator is twice the 
  frequency of the carrier, then the first upper sideband is: C+M = 1+2 = 3. The 
  second upper sideband is: C+2M = 1+(2x2) = 1+4 = 5. Another way to get the 
  second sideband is to add M=2 to the value of the first sideband which is 3; 
  i.e. (C+M) + M = 3+2 = 5. It quickly becomes clear that the upper sidebands in 
  this example are all the odd numbers, and since the carrier is 1, the upper 
  sidebands are all the odd harmonics, with the carrier as the fundamental (i.e. 
  the lowest frequency in the spectrum).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>However, if our C:M were </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM2to5.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>2:5</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, the first upper sideband would be 2+5 = 
  7. Since 7 is not a multiple of 2, it would be termed inharmonic. But the 
  second upper sideband would be 7+5 = 12, and that is the 6th harmonic. 
  Therefore, we can see that sidebands can be harmonic or inharmonic.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>The </FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=+1><B>lower 
  sidebands</B></FONT><FONT size=+1> are: C-M, C-2M, C-3M, C-4M, C-5M, 
  ...</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>When the sideband is a positive number it will lie below the 
  carrier, but at some point, its value will become negative. It is then said to 
  be <B>reflected</B> because we simply drop the minus sign and treat it as a 
  positive number, e.g. the sideband -3 appears in the spectrum as 3. 
  Acoustically, however, this reflected process involves a phase inversion, i.e. 
  the spectral component is 180 degrees out of phase. Mathematically, we express 
  this reflection by using absolute value signs around the expression: /C-M/ to 
  indicate that we drop the minus and treat the number as positive.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For example, for </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, the 1st lower sideband is: /C-M/ = /1-2/ 
  = /-1/ =1.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>The second lower sideband is: /C-2M/ = /1-(2x2)/ = /1-4/ = 
  /-3/ = 3. However, to make things easier, we could have added 2 to the first 
  lower sideband (1), which is already reflected, and have obtained 
3.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For the ratio </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, the 1st lower sideband is 0 (inaudible) 
  and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th lower sidebands are 1, 2, 3, respectively.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM7to5.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>7:5</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, the lower sidebands are: 2, 3, 8, 13, 
  ... where 3 is the 1st reflected one. One concern we have in using a given C:M 
  ratio is whether the carrier frequency is the lowest frequency in the 
  spectrum, i.e. is it the fundamental? If it is, we can treat the carrier 
  frequency as the principal pitch that will be heard in the resulting 
  timbre.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>First we have the case of the </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1> ratio whose upper sidebands are 2, 3, 4, 
  ... and whose lower sidebands are 0, 1, 2, 3, ... Clearly the carrier is the 
  lowest non-zero component, and all the sidebands are harmonics, i.e. 
  multiples. Because 1:1 is the only ratio with a zero lower sideband, it is a 
  special case. It is also the only ratio producing the entire harmonic series. 
  For other ratios, we can work out their sidebands and decide if any of them 
  are lower than the carrier. That is fine, but tedious, and we'd like to know 
  in advance what to expect. First, we might note that in the </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1> case the 1st lower sideband is /-1/ = 1; 
  therefore it falls against the carrier. Further, if M is larger than twice C, 
  e.g. </FONT><A href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM2to5.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>2:5</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, then the 1st reflected sideband will 
  always be greater than the carrier.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Work out a few examples and you'll find that the rule 
  is:</FONT></P>
  <CENTER><FONT size=+1><B>FOR THE CARRIER TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL, M MUST BE 
  GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO TWICE C, OR ELSE BE THE 1:1 
RATIO.</B></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Another useful property to be familiar with is the 
  occurrence, as you may have noticed already, of lower sidebands coinciding 
  with the upper set. They are said to 'fall against' them.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>What this means acoustically is that the amplitudes of the 
  two sidebands will add together, influenced as well by the phase inversion of 
  the reflected sideband. Since the amplitude of each sideband varies according 
  to the strength of the modulation, as expressed by the Modulation Index, the 
  sum of the contributions of each sideband becomes quite complex!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>You've probably noticed that the sidebands of the </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1> ratio have this property of falling 
  against each other. You'll find a very similar pattern with all of the N:1 
  ratios, i.e. </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM2to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>2:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM3to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>3:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM4to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>4:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM5to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>5:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM6to1.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>6:1</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, ...</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>The second type of ratio showing the same property is that 
  like 1:2. The odd harmonics are found in both the upper and lower sidebands. 
  Therefore we can extrapolate the second case, namely odd N:2, that is, the 
  ratios </FONT><A href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM1to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>1:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM3to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>3:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM5to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>5:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM7to2.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>7:2</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>, ...</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>No other ratios except N:1 and odd N:2 have this property. 
  All ratios other than N:1 and odd N:2 have an asymmetrical spacing of their 
  sidebands. That is, the distance in frequency between adjacent sidebands is 
  unequal. For instance, the ratio </FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM2to5.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>2:5</FONT></A><FONT size=+1> with its sidebands 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, .... 
  However, there is still a pattern to the spacing.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>We want the distance between the first upper sideband (C + M) 
  and the first reflected lower sideband (C - M) which is negative by definition 
  and therefore can be made positive to give the expression (M - C). Subtract 
  these two frequencies to get: (C + M) - (M - C) = 2C We find that the answer 
  is 2C. Since the spacing of all upper or lower sidebands is M, then the 
  remaining spacing is M - 2C.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Therefore the rule is:</FONT></P>
  <CENTER><FONT size=+1><B>WHEN C IS THE LOWEST FREQUENCY IN THE SPECTRUM, THE 
  SPACING OF SIDEBANDS ABOVE IT (EXCEPT FOR 1:1) WILL BE: M - 2.C &amp; 
  2.C</B></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For the above example (</FONT><A 
  href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/Sound/FM2to5.aiff"><FONT 
  size=+1>2:5</FONT></A><FONT size=+1>), the spacing is 2x2=4 and 5-4=1. Note 
  that we have to start with C as the fundamental. This will be referred to in 
  the next section as the <B>Normal Form</B> of the Ratio.</FONT></P>
  <CENTER><FONT color=#af0000 size=+2><I>Normal Form of the C:M 
  Ratio</I></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1><B>Definition:</B> <I>a C:M ratio is in Normal Form (NF) when 
  the carrier is the fundamental in the spectrum it produces.</I></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1><B>Rule:</B> <I>for a ratio to be in Normal Form, M must be 
  greater than or equal to twice C, or else be the ratio 1:1.</I></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>What we are doing with the concept of Normal Form is 
  providing the basis of a classification scheme for all ratios, and at the same 
  time codifying our rule of thumb about the conditions for the carrier to be 
  the fundamental. If we consider only ratios involving integers up to 9, we can 
  list all those in Normal Form:</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT size=+1>These have been listed in an order related to what's called 
  the <B>Farey Series</B> where the value of M/C is increasing, or C/M is

  <CENTER><FONT color=#af0000 size=+2><I>Reducing a Non Normal Form Ratio to its 
  Normal Form </I></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>When the M value in a ratio is less than twice the C value, 
  it is not in Normal Form, but can be reduced to it by applying the 
  operation:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>C = /C - M/</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1>What this means is that you subtract M from C (ignoring any 
  minus sign) and treat the result as the new C value. You keep doing this until 
  the ratio satisfies the Normal Form criterion.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Consider, for example, the ratio 3:1. We first take 3-1=2 and 
  get the ratio 2:1, which is still not in Normal Form. Another application of 
  the operation gives us 2-1=1 and the ratio 1:1 which is in Normal Form by 
  definition.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>A trickier example is 8:5. First we reduce 8-5=3 and get 3:5 
  (not NF). Reducing again, we get 3-5=-2, which becomes 2:5 (ignoring the 
  minus!) and because 5 is greater than twice 2, we have a Normal Form ratio. 
  Notice that the reduction operation is the reverse of generating 
  sidebands.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT size=+1>When a ratio is not in Normal Form, and you want to know if 
  it is harmonic or not, you can reduce it to Normal Form &amp; find out. 
  However, ratios with M = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are always harmonic; for M=5, 7, 8, 9, 
  check if C is a multiple of M plus or minus 1; if so, it's harmonic. For 
  instance, 9:5, 11:5, 14:5 and 16:5 are members of the 1:5 family whose C 
  values are 10-1, 10+1, 15-1, 15+1. On the other hand, </FONT><A

  <CENTER><FONT color=#af0000 size=+2><I>Calculating The Fundamental 
  Frequency</I></FONT></CENTER>
  <P><FONT size=+1>Once we are thinking along the lines of families of ratios 
  producing the same set of sidebands, we may want to know how to calculate the 
  right carrier frequency for a family member ratio that produces the same 
  spectrum as the Normal Form ratio on a given fundamental-carrier, e.g. 100 Hz 
  for ease of calculation. In the PODX system this can be done for you 
  automatically when you ask for the frequencies to be treated as modulators 
  (note: M is constant for a family). To do the calculation yourself, take a 
  Normal Form ratio NFC:M with a given carrier frequency. Then for a given 
  family member ratio C:M, what should its carrier frequency (FC) be to keep the 
  fundamental the same?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>The equation is:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>FC = (C ratio) x (NF Carrier frequency) / (NFC 
    ratio)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For example, if the NF carrier frequency is 100 Hz for 1:1, 
  then the corresponding carrier for 3:1 is (3x100/1) = 300 Hz. For any 1:N 
  ratio we can get the answer by taking C x 100. For a NFC:M ratio, we take C x 
  100 / NFC, e.g. for 7:5 and 2:5, the carrier for 7:5 is 7x100/2 = 350 Hz. 
  Acoustically we hear a non NF family member on a high carrier as having its 
  energy distributed around high partials, rather than centred on the 
  fundamental, at least for a low modulation index.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>When we use a non Normal Form ratio with a specific carrier 
  frequency, we often want to know what is its fundamental frequency, or we wish 
  a specific fundamental and want to know how to calculate the appropriate 
  carrier. This is done for you in PODX when you request that the frequency be 
  treated as the fundamental. The program calculates the right carrier to 
  produce the fundamental that is required.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>To calculate the fundamental (FF) for a non Normal Form ratio 
  C:M whose carrier is known, we need to know the Normal Form of the ratio 
  NFC:M, and then we can use the equation:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>FF = (Carrier frequency) x (NFC ratio) / (C 
    ratio)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=+1>For example, with 5:2 and a carrier of 500 Hz, the Normal 
  Form ratio is 1:2 and therefore the fundamental is (500 x 1 / 5) = 100 Hz. 
  Similarly, for 7:5 and a carrier of 700 Hz, the Normal Form ratio is 2:5, and 
  therefore the fundamental is (700 x 2 / 7) = 200 Hz.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=+1>If we know the fundamental and need the carrier, we can use 
  the equation:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>Carrier = (Fundamental) x (C ratio) / (NFC 
    ratio)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
